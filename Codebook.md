# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 

You will be required to submit: 
<ol>
  <li>a tidy data set as described below</li>
  <li>a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis</li>
  <li>a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.</li>
</ol>

You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
